# Project Brief

<!--
Fill this template after running init_project.
Give it to the AI after @docs/ai_codev/AI_CONTEXT_FULL.md
-->

## Vision (1-2 phrases)

What problem does this project solve? For whom?

> _Example: "A tool that helps researchers track experiment results without switching contexts."_

**Your vision:**
> [Write here]

## Constraints (what we know for sure)

- [ ] Must run on: [local / cloud / both]
- [ ] Data sensitivity: [public / internal / confidential]
- [ ] Timeline pressure: [exploration / deadline-driven]
- [ ] Team size: [solo / small team / large team]

## Architecture (optional)

Reference a proven pattern from `docs/architecture_suggestions/`:

- [ ] `DAG_PIPELINE.md` — DAG Pipeline with Nodes/Providers/Backends (ML, GenAI, ETL)
- [ ] Other: [describe]
- [ ] None yet — we'll decide together

## Open Questions (we'll decide together)

These are NOT decided yet. We'll figure them out during development:

- Data storage?
- Key libraries/frameworks?
- Testing strategy beyond the template defaults?

## For the AI: Comprehension Check

After reading this brief and the philosophy docs, please:

1. **Summarize** your understanding of the project in 2-3 sentences
2. **Identify** any ambiguities or missing information
3. **Ask** 2-3 clarifying questions before we start coding

This ensures we have shared understanding before implementation.
