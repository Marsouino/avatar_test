# Code Clarity Rules
# ==================
# These rules enforce code clarity and maintainability:
# - No legacy naming (no confusion about what's current)
# - Explicit imports (know where things come from)

rules:
  # ============================================================
  # ZERO LEGACY
  # ============================================================

  - id: no-legacy-naming
    pattern-regex: (legacy|deprecated|old_|_old|_v1\b|_v2\b|_backup|Old[A-Z])
    paths:
      include:
        - "*.py"
    message: |
      [!] Legacy naming detected

      Don't keep old code around. Either:
      - Migrate fully and delete the old version
      - If still used, it's the current version (remove "legacy" from name)
