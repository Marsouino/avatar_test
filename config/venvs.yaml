# Virtual Environment Architecture
# ==================================
# Maps each module to its venv and test directory.
# Used by scripts/run_all_tests.py to run pytest in the correct venv.
#
# Each module is tested in isolation in its own venv.
# Static analysis (semgrep, ruff, mypy) runs from venv_policy/ and doesn't need this.
#
# INSTRUCTIONS: Add entries as your project grows.
# Remove the example entries and add your own.

# Note: venv_policy/ is managed separately by init_project and is not listed here.
# It contains static analysis tools (semgrep, ruff, mypy, pre-commit) only.

# Default project module — start here, split into multiple as deps diverge
modules:
  core:
    venv: venv                          # Project venv
    requirements: requirements.txt
    tests: tests/unit                   # Test directory for this module

  # Examples for multi-venv projects (uncomment and adapt):
  #
  # pose:
  #   venv: venv_pose
  #   requirements: modules/pose/requirements.txt
  #   tests: tests/unit/pose
  #
  # generation:
  #   venv: venv_generation
  #   requirements: modules/generation/requirements.txt
  #   tests: tests/unit/generation
  #
  # upscaling:
  #   venv: venv_upscaling
  #   requirements: modules/upscaling/requirements.txt
  #   tests: tests/unit/upscaling
